 * official extension's value — but it (a) never defeated the gate, since the gate
 * ignores Origin, and (b) crashed Safari on load: WebKit dereferences a null rule
 * array inside `WebExtensionContext::loadDeclarativeNetRequestRules` →
 * `getRulesWithRuleIDs`, taking the whole browser down (EXC_BAD_ACCESS).
 *
 * So we no longer ship any CORS-bypass ruleset. The only viable path for
 * api.anthropic.com is an out-of-process native-messaging proxy (full signed build).
