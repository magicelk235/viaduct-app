# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Viaduct is distributed as a rolling release: only the latest version on the
`main` branch and the most recent published build receive security fixes. If
you are running an older build, update before reporting an issue.

| Version        | Supported          |

| Latest release | :white_check_mark: |
| Older builds   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately through one of:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** — open a draft advisory at
  <https://github.com/magicelk235/viaduct-app/security/advisories/new>
  (preferred).
- **Email** — yehonatan.2350@gmail.com with subject line `SECURITY: viaduct-app`.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce (a proof-of-concept if you have one).
- Affected version, macOS version, and any relevant configuration.

## What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 5 business days.
- An assessment and, where confirmed, a fix timeline. Most issues are patched
  in the next release.
- Credit in the release notes once a fix ships, unless you ask to stay
  anonymous.

Please give a reasonable window to release a fix before any public disclosure.

## Scope Notes

Viaduct wraps the [`@magicelk235/viaduct`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicelk235/viaduct)
command-line tool and can download extensions from the Chrome Web Store, sign
them with your local Apple identity, and self-update the bundled CLI from npm.
Reports touching any of these paths — CLI invocation, code signing, the
`viaduct://` URL scheme, or the auto-update flow — are in scope. Vulnerabilities
in the upstream CLI package itself should be reported against that package.
